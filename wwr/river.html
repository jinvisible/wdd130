                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon
                    river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return
                    by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to
                    visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

                <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and
                    bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
                    with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the
                    campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of
                    the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the
                    water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and
                    warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with
                    children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
