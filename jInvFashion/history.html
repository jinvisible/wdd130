                <p>The history of men’s fashion doesn’t get so major until 1800’s. A lot of fashion brands and fashion items were born in
                    that era, like Yves Saint Laurent and Dior for brands, jeans and MA1 jacket for items. There are two major event that
                    changed the fashion industry so much and those events were two world wars. These wars changed the outfits of men from
                    wearing suits and ties with a hat to military jacket, jeans, and t-shirt. Fashion industry begins to fly after the WW2.
                    Different silhouette of jackets, shits, and pants came out and made different trends for every decade. Now, men’s fashion
                    is more varied ever before. Most of the boundaries of men’s and women’s started to fade and there are so many looks
                    almost by every single person.
