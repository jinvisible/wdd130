      <p>
        How well do you know about fashion? Do you consider yourself an expert? Or are you a beginner who just started to have
        interest in it? No matter who you are and how much you know, you are so welcome here! How much do you care about your
        fashion? Some people might not care about how they look. However, when we first meet a stranger, there are nothing to
        measure about that person but how they look. That doesn’t mean you have to stay sharp about your outfits constantly,
        but it is always better to look nice and clean to give a good impression to other people around. Now, if you get deeper
        down into the fashion, it is interesting that people have different trending outfits by what country they are living in.
        It is not about traditional clothes in each country, but clothes that people wear now (modern clothes). This happens
        because of several different reasons. Cultural difference is one thing. Fashion industry often follows the cultural
        trends. For example, lot of people are obsessed with a pair of sneakers called ‘Nike Dunk Low’ in Korea. That happened
        because a lot of K-pop artists wore them. Second thing that makes the difference is the weather. In Northern countries
        in Europe, you can see a lot of people wearing knitwear and coat. There is a name for that certain looks and they are
        called ‘Nordic Fashion’. This happens because it is mostly cold every day in that area.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The history of men’s fashion doesn’t get so major until 1800’s. A lot of fashion brands and fashion items were born in
        that era, like Yves Saint Laurent and Dior for brands, jeans and MA1 jacket for items. There are two major event that
        changed the fashion industry so much and those events were two world wars. These wars changed the outfits of men from
        wearing suits and ties with a hat to military jacket, jeans, and t-shirt. Fashion industry begins to fly after the WW2.
        Different silhouette of jackets, shits, and pants came out and made different trends for every decade. Now, men’s fashion
        is more varied ever before. Most of the boundaries of men’s and women’s started to fade and there are so many looks
        almost by every single person.

      <h3>Trends</h3>
      <p>
        What is the latest trend now? Before we talk about the looks, we need to talk about trending fashion brand now days.
        Almost every trend starts from the high-end brands. They first show their look books to public and other designer
        brands look at the high-end brand’s latest clothes and try to catch what is going to lead that season. After most of
        the designer brands finish their season, that is where the domestic brands start their season. They check the look
        books of various high-end and designer brands to see what outfits will lead this season. And this process is repeated
        all the way down to no brand products. So, it is important to know the process how the trends spread, which is always
        to check the high-end brands to see what is new. Now we just learned the process how trends spread. Let’s talk about
        the leading brands right now. Form my perspective, ‘Louis Vuitton’, which Virgil Abloh was the director few months ago,
        and ‘Celine’ with Hedi Slimane being a creative director are the trendiest brands now. Trending looks and moods are
        getting more casual and sportier every year. Most of the formal looks and brands are influenced by the casual trend.
        Wearing suits with sneakers are not an unusual thing anymore. Giorgio Armani, who is a founder of brand ‘Armani’
        recently said ‘The time of wearing tie is now past’. We learned that casual and sporty looks are trending now days what
        about the color? The color of the year 2022, selected by ‘Pantone’, is ‘very peri’. ‘Very peri’ is a color in purple color set.
