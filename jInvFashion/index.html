                <p>How well do you know about fashion? Do you consider yourself an expert? Or are you a beginner who just started to have
                    interest in it? No matter who you are and how much you know, you are so welcome here! How much do you care about your
                    fashion? Some people might not care about how they look. However, when we first meet a stranger, there are nothing to
                    measure about that person but how they look. That doesn’t mean you have to stay sharp about your outfits constantly,
                    but it is always better to look nice and clean to give a good impression to other people around. Now, if you get deeper
                    down into the fashion, it is interesting that people have different trending outfits by what country they are living in.
                    It is not about traditional clothes in each country, but clothes that people wear now (modern clothes). This happens
                    because of several different reasons. Cultural difference is one thing. Fashion industry often follows the cultural
                    trends. For example, lot of people are obsessed with a pair of sneakers called ‘Nike Dunk Low’ in Korea. That happened
                    because a lot of K-pop artists wore them. Second thing that makes the difference is the weather. In Northern countries
                    in Europe, you can see a lot of people wearing knitwear and coat. There is a name for that certain looks and they are
                    called ‘Nordic Fashion’. This happens because it is mostly cold every day in that area.
